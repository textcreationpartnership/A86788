            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>THat whereas Your Petitioners have long lien under the burthen of these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine and devouring Wars, and are now lifted up with the hopes of a blessed Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine of Peace breaking forth upon us for the dispelling of all those mists that have wrapt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116876:3"/> us up in this long Misery: In which Peace well setled none shall more rejoyce then your Petitioners, being ready to accept it as the fruit of all our labors, losses, crosses, yea all our hazards in this great adventure: Heartily praising the Lord for all your faithful endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to extricate us, and our afflicted Friends of these three Kingdoms out of our deep and unparaleld miseries: And perceiving the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Treaty to be looked on by you as the great and last way to bring over unto us this so much beloved and longed for Peace, in which (seeing our concernment is so eminent, and our posterity gasping to receive the fruits of what we have sowen in tears and blood) we humbly crave leave to mind you of two Declarations, the one from the Assembly of the Church of Scotland, dated July the 5. 1645 charging his Majesty with spilling the blood of many Thousands of his best Subjects in the three Kingdoms: and the other of your own, Febr. the 15. 1647. wherein you give Reasons for no further Addresses, and speak as high as that of Scotland. We might add thereunto that also in answer to the Scottish
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116876:3"/> Commissioners Papers, dated the 4th of March 1647. All which have made our ears to tingle and our hearts to tremble, expecting with amazement what satisfaction you might have to these loud-crying and Heaven-provoking Crimes: viz. That about the death of his Royal Father: The betraying of Rochel; The Spanish Fleet with an Army in it: His Proclamation to cry down Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: His correspondency with Rome: The private Articles of his Marriage: His Commissions to the Rebels in Ireland: His violent attempt upon the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: The inviting of Forreigners to inslave the three Nations: His proclaiming the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of England Rebels: The designed bloody Massacre in London by his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: His destructive principle of yeelding an Account to none but God: His inviting over the Irish Rebels to subdue this Parliament: His backwardness to declare against them: Together with the eight years Misery of the three Kingdoms; <hi>Cum multis aliis.</hi> And yet your selves say these are but some few
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116876:4"/> of the many Reasons why you cannot repose any more trust in him.</p>
               <p>The Premisses considered, we desire, for our selves and the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we may not be left in the dark concerning these Suggestions and Charges; which if true, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings may be accordingly, that we may not build our Peace upon such ruining foundations: but if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, that his Majesty may be cleared so fully, that we may neither fear your Treating with him nor Trusting him in the great and weighty affairs of the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. And we most earnestly beg, that since Your God and Ours hath put so many principal Enemies into Your hands, even to wonder, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116876:4"/> impartial and personal Justice may equally and speedily be administred, which we look at as the undoubted Remedy of all our Maladies; for Justice exalteth a Nation and establisheth a Throne.
